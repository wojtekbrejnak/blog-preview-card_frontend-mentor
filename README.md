### Continued development

As I continue to learn to become a Junior Front-end Developer, I plan to explore the following areas:

- JavaScript Integration: Incorporating JavaScript functionality to enhance user interactions and dynamic content.
- Responsive Design: Ensuring my web application looks great on various devices and screen sizes.
- Version Control: Learning more about Git and GitHub and using it effectively for collaborative development.
- Testing and Debugging: Improving my skills in identifying and fixing issues in my code.
- Deployment: Deploying my project to a live server for public access.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn) - This is the number one resource for every developer. I frequently refer to it for comprehensive and up-to-date information.
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) - An incredible open-source coding education resource. Its hands-on approach empowers you to build things from scratch right from the beginning.
